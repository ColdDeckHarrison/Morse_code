# Morse_code
text into morse code
# # convert all string into morse code.
# user input will be put into a split list.
# for loop to find each letter and compare it with a dictionary
#     key: value will be letter: morse symbol
# convert each letter into the corresponding morse code symbol while ignoring spaces, symbols and numbers.
# return the new string with the correct morse code.

Its a very simple code with a very simple output. It could easily change morse code to the english letter again there just happens to be a much higher risk of error converting the other way.
